                    <p>I have started working on the implementation of my plan, <a name="ref1"></a><a href="#note1">[1]</a>
and now I attached a resulting image came from it.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p><img src="/assets/completeness.jpg" class="big" title="Completeness Boxplot" alt="Completeness Boxplot" /></p>

<p>What you can see in the image is three charts. The first one contains
the completenes boxplot of the full Europeana records, the second one
is the same report for the search API records, and the last one shows
the number of records per data providers.</p>

<p>I should start somewhere so I collected all the records match the
query <a href="http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=*%3A*&amp;qf=COUNTRY%3Ahungary">COUNTRY:hungary</a> which produces 690K records, a bit more than 1,5% of all Europeana records.
I used the API, and saved two files: one for the
full records, one for the search API records. Each files contain one
record per line in JSON format, but I removed the metadata type
elements of the API, such as the number of records, the number of
requests etc. I used api2demo as API key. Sometimes I had to stop the
process, and thus at the end there is a small difference in the number
of records in each files. To harvest the records took 1,5 days, which
is pretty slow for this purpose.</p>

<p>I have created two schema representation files, which contained the
elements and their types. I should note, that the API documentation at
the Labs site is a bit outdated, it seems, that there are new fields
which are not documented, and some type note is false. With a somewhat
fresh eye, it is clear, that there are some inconsistency between
record and search API result format, for example there are 3 different
way how to present language variations.</p>

<p>The measure of the completeness is simple: I count the existing
fields, and the total number of the fields. If an existing field
contains multiple instances, then I give it more weights. There could
be some more tweaking in this calculation, but it was good for start.</p>

<p>I run the two calculation (records again records schema, and search
records against search record schema) in a batch process based on
Hadoop. In case you don’t know Hadoop: it is the other invention of
Doug Cutting, the inventor of Apache Lucene (the basis of Solr,
Europeana’s search engine), for distributed computations. I let the
user to scale the application by distribute the computations over
several commodity machines. It splits the input file into smaller
chunks and sent to different nodes along with the definitions of tasks
to run on the data to work paralelly by implementing the MapReduce
paradigm.</p>

<p>The program right now produce a flat file containing name value pairs,
in this case the data provider name and ID of the record as key, and
the result of the calculation which is a number between 0 and 1 where
0 means the worst possible record having no relevant field, and
1 is
the exemplar record having all the schema fields.</p>

<p>Then I run an R script with these result which produces the boxplot
charts. The general feature of boxplot is, that it shows the
distribution of the “quartiles”: if we separate the range of the
values into 4 equal parts, the lower and top quarles displayed with
dotted lines, the inner quartiles form a box, and a line shows the
mean. The result shows the distribution of typical values, ad the
extreme values. If the box is small it means, that the records are
similar in terms of completeness, if the box is large it means, that
the records are different: there are better and worse records and so
on.</p>

<p>There were some conclusions when I saw the charts:</p>

<p>1) there is at least one collection where the box is too condensed,
and it might mean, that the records are created the very same way, and
they might contains same information. I have checked this collection,
and it turned out, that some of the fields which were the basis of
enhancements are really the same, so they get the same Place and
Concepts - so enhancement has an effect which enlarge similarities of
some fields. I guess I should add a different completeness measurement
without these entities.</p>

<p>2) the full and search record’s completeness numbers are quite
different. I am thinking about the reasons (I know some cases where
the Solr index had and still has errors), but I should investigate it
more.</p>

<p>I’ve put the source code of the Hadoop part into my GitHub account:
<a href="https://github.com/pkiraly/europeana-qa">https://github.com/pkiraly/europeana-qa</a></p>

<p>These are just the baby steps, and there are lots on my plate, so I’ll
go further. If you interested, from time to time I will create such a
reports - maybe in a different form. If you have any suggestions or
notice, please let me know.</p>

<p>Cheers,
Péter</p>

<p><a name="note1"></a> <a href="#ref1">[1]</a> My research plan’s title is ‘Metadata Quality 
Assurance Framework’, and is about how to measure the “goodness” of metadata records
in cultural heritage databases, such as a digital library, a traditional
library catalog, or even in research data archives.</p>
