I don't travel too much, but if you are around [GÃ¶ttingen, Germany](https://www.google.de/maps/place/G%C3%B6ttingen/@51.5370233,9.8566411,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x47a4d4b86f98cac7:0x425ac6d94ac3e30?hl=en), I am happy to talk to you personally. My office -- at the time of writing -- is in the very first building of the university.
