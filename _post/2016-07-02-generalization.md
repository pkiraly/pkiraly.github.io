# Making General

In the last weeks I was working on making the framework really general and reusable in other project.
The initiative came from Europeana. They would like to build in the measurement into their ingestion
service. It was a good occasion to separate different concerns of the source code.

Now we have a top level (software) project: [Metadata Quality Assurance Framework API](http://github.com/pkiraly/metadata-qa-api)
