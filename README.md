This repository stores the source of my GitHub.io pages of [Metadata Quality Assessment Framework](http://pkiraly.github.io)

Note from 2023: originally the project was called Metadata Quality Assurance Framework, but I lowered the bar, so it is now "only" assess the quality, without preventation or fix.
