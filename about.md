My name is Péter Király, and I am a software developer, analyst. My main interests are publishing and searching large text corporas in the web, and the new ways of web presence of cultural heritage (mainly library and archival materials with special focus on semantic web technologies). Recently I am focusing on application of data science methods in these fields, which lead to my research project which is to find "good" and "bad" records in metadata repositories. During the project I will create a general framework, which lets repositories and digital libraries (such as [Europeana](http://europeana.eu), [TextGrid](http://textgrid.de) or [Digital Public Library of America](http://dp.la)) to run a range of measurements on the collection, and get suggestion where they should improve the quality of their metadata.
